### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) - This helped in learning alot about CSS selectors. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44508241/button-styling-with-after-pseudo-element) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to style buttons. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
